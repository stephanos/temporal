"""`tracker sync-body` - write/readback + paired merge base (fn-140.5).

Server readback is canonical for the tracker half. mergeBaseFlow stays the
exact --flow-file body (comparable to the local spec); mergeBaseTracker is
trackerBodyForMerge(readback). Both halves commit atomically under the shared
config_lock. Partial failure leaves the prior base untouched.

The WHOLE read/write/readback/commit transaction is serialized per spec via a
create-first claim (`syncbody-<spec-id>.json`) taken BEFORE any tracker I/O -
without it two overlapping invocations each finish their write/readback and
the OLDER one can acquire config_lock last, overwriting the newer paired base
with a stale pair (tracker holds body B, mergeBaseTracker records body A).
Every transaction additionally takes a provider + durable-issue keyed body claim,
shared with direct wire body updates and GitLab `relate`, because these paths
must not change the remote body between sync-body's read and paired-base commit.

<!-- flow:deps --> is stripped at the hash boundary (R10 half deferred from
.4) and carried forward on every push write so a full-body update cannot
self-delete the block.
