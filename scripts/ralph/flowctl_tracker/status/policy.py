"""fn-66 merge-evidence gate + who-wins ladder (fn-140.3).

Ports status-sync.md faithfully into the CLI six-slot vocabulary
(backlog|todo|in_progress|in_review|done|cancelled). Legacy names map:
planned→todo, in-progress→in_progress, done/verified→done (verified keeps
its evidence distinction in the gate, not the slot name), deferred/wontfix→
cancelled-family (surfaced, never auto-applied).

Deadlock check fires FIRST — a terminal×in_progress pair matches BOTH
