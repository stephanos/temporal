    through its receipt so relink/clear cannot split persistence from evidence.

    Two concurrent creates against the same unlinked spec could both pass the
    unlocked linkState check and both reach the provider mutation - two
    remote issues, the later link write orphaning the first. Under the lock:
    the linkState is re-checked from a RELOADED spec, a live claim from
    another process refuses (create_in_flight), and OUR pending claim lands
    durably before any remote mutation. The CRASH window (claim written,
    create landed, process died before the link write) stays open by spec
    decision - this closes only the live concurrent race."""
