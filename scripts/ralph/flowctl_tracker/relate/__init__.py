"""Spec-aware `tracker relate` verb (fn-140.4).

Reproduces fn-64's contract: depRelations ledger (same edge-key semantics as
flowctl), additive-only, never-clobber-on-collision (queued + receipt, never
overwrite). Completed blockers are PROJECTED - the relation stays visible on
the tracker as the historical ordering (docs/tracker-sync.md fn-64 rule);
only readiness gating excludes done deps, and that lives in flowctl's ready
computation, not here. The 4-way ledger x remote classification runs BEFORE
any mutation: ledger+remote noop, ledger+missing = human removal collision
(queued, default NOT re-created), unledgered+remote = foreign-edge collision
(queued), neither = create.

GitLab writes the <!-- flow:deps --> direction/provenance twin with every
native or degraded link and repairs it before finalizing an interrupted
create. Its whole-description read/replace is serialized with GitLab
sync-body and direct wire pushes by their shared remote-resource claim. Hash
exclusion remains sync-body's concern.

GitHub: native sub_issues is a HIERARCHY PROXY reported only in the structured
degraded field - never presented as a blocked-by relation; body-block
projection is .5's body machinery.
